Migrate from old to new repositories

Please know that the old repository is unmantained, and there are some erros relating packages.

3 new repositories were created, and in 64 bits systems a transition is needed.

1) First of all, you need to manually remove the old portergos repository from `/etc/pacman.conf`. Open the file with sudo or as root and remove Portergos repository. Save the file.

2) Downlad the script from https://github.com/Portergos/portergos-iso/blob/master/fix_repository_definitive and run it as sudo or root.

3) Add the new repositories to `/etc/pacman.conf`.
```
[portergos_64]
SigLevel = PackageRequired
Include = /etc/pacman.d/portergos-mirrorlist

[portergos_any]
SigLevel = PackageRequired
Include = /etc/pacman.d/portergos_any-mirrorlist
```

Save the file and update your system with `sudo pacman -Syyu`
Done!
