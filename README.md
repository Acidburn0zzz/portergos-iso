I'm very happy to announce my UNOFFICIAL iso. 
It's build using mkarchiso and use both Antergos and Arclinux repositories

Purposes of the iso:

- Easy experince using i3-wm 
- Ergonomic tools (easystroke, lxsession, xfdesktop, xfce4-panel)
- Use Archlinux+Antergos+AUR repositories
- Offline installer (modified from Pacbang linux)
- Online installer (Cnchi - Antregos)
- Minimum systemd load after install (internet, cups, avahi, vboxservice and sddm)
- Use both iso/installed system as installer for others devices

Security:

- ClamAV installed and some basic scripts for using it
- Firejail (Opera and Firefox are set to start using firejail, changed in /usr/share/applications)

Games

- Wine+Playonlinux
- Steam

Others

- Oblogout for logoff
- Zim for notes
- Redshift for eyes confort
- Conky manager
- Xed as text editor
- Caja as file manager

NEW VERSION - August 17th 2017
Changes:
1) Added a new option inside the offline installer (Keep changes made while running the iso, and also used to install from installed system like USBs to another hd or USB)
2) Added Cnchi (everthing seems to work, i just removed the zfs support, and Antergos' wallpapers are not installed in the new system)
3) You can run both offline and cnchi installers from the installed system, that means you can spread this OS system everywhere with a USB drive :P
