Hi! Welcome to Portergos develop page. This distro is based on archlinux and contains an offline installer, forked from PacBang.

Portergos means "Portable Antergos" - Though Antergos distro is ending, i'm keeping the name, perhaps in the future will be called "Posterus" which means "future" in Latin and have a very similar name.

I'm simplifying Portergos iso, basically removing stuff. I believe K.I.S.S filosophy is the best for an "one man made distro"
The offline installer is maintained, all others were removed.
Openbox will still be installed, but only xfce4 and i3 will be available at the welcome screen.

I'm also working to have calamares installer, which i hope in the future may contain online and offline installer with a nice simple interface.

Repositories:
Archlinux only

Offline installer
